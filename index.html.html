		<h1>Project Plan: N4Slab Proposal</h1>
	</header>

	<main>
		<p class="section-1">According to the UN (United Nations), 55 percent of the worldâ€™s population currently lives in urban areas, with a portion of 68 percent to increase by 2050. 82 percent of the population in North America currently resides in urban areas. As populations in city environments continue to rise, more projects of property buildings, businesses, and housing are being planned in accordance. With much happening in urban planning, there has become a high demand in the supply chain for construction. More companies are recognizing the use of sustainable materials and how they can implement practices into their projects. One main effective outcome that benefits both companies and the environment is carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration is a process that stores carbon from the atmosphere. This practice can be mitigated by the use of certain natural materials, such as mass timber and other natural resources (e.g., plants, soil, waterways). This may benefit both the company and the environment, as storing carbon can help preserve carbon credits accessible to businesses and dilute a percentage of carbon emissions from construction and urban environments.</p>
		<p class="section-2">A fictitious truth I have proposed is a new model that may benefit all requirements needed to mitigate circular construction effectively. This model focuses on the use of both exterior and interior projects. It may also be used for smaller building projects as well, such as stalls, tables, and chairs. This wooden framed model is a flexible slab, having components that would be able to meet the requirements needed to build both small and bigger projects. With forms of timber included as part of the ingredients for firmness and plywood to help sustain flexibility. This structure can help in movements where slabs can cover certain surfaces, as well as an alternative component in buildings having the use of cemented bricks and metal forms. This particular slab would have effects of nearly all materials in terms of durability and formatting. Such chemicals used would be naturally sourced during laboratory processes in creating wooden slabs. Such laboratory practices would maintain the environmental goal of using materials, keeping products and processes carbon neutral. The wooden slab model can be given either in bulk or singular, which can help in maintaining economical structures and overall consumption in the built environment. I believe that sustainable practice and regeneration is a necessity in the built environment as our population continues to rise and more projects are going into effect. Noting that blueprints can be altered to perform constructive designs using resources, this proposition can help sectors utilize natural products, taking advantage of such natural components.</p>
