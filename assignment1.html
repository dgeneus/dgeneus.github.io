	  <p>I think that 404 page not found by Kate Wagner has brought enlightenment to creating an
	  engaging essay that provides a nostalgic point of view on the early ages of web development.
	  The essay concludes with many aspects that formatted the beginning of Geocities aesthetics
	  and web creation, regulating the inspirations and influences of developers throughout this era.
	  In her essay, I admired how she expressed her truest passion for the development of geo-cities
	  and the importance of the creators. Her research has concluded the overall history of Web 2.0,
	  and sharing insights on this era has dramatically impacted her childhood experiences, including
	  her past. Her storytelling evoked an expression of passionate activism towards the platform’s
	  creators and design, concluding barriers of which others have relied on this platform to share
	  their stories that may have been limited online through her experiences and what she has
	  witnessed in different eras of web development. Before reading her essay, I was newly
	  introduced to the concept of the Geocities platform. I was familiar with a few notations that have
	  contributed to the quirky design aesthetic, such as gifs she mentioned and other insights. As
	  I’ve gathered information on the technicalities of developing this platform from the essay, I have
	  taken the time to understand the history of its online development and how it has been affected
	  by other platforms.</p>

	  <p>In the section “Hell of Beautiful Interfaces”, where she expressed the history of digital archives,
	  it was interesting how such archives have related to internet commerces. Before learning more
	  about the Geocities platform itself, I assumed that it was more of a creative outlet for users to
	  share their concepts of digital design or overall digital satire structures which mimic meaning
	  pop culture during its time when Kate concluded her analysis of Olia Liana’s platform which
	  have documented old archives and provided contribution for dot-com users, I was introduced to
	  the fact that the platform had provided other essential uses. I realized that Geocities was a
	  gateway for smaller developers who intended to share their stories and businesses through this
	  platform. Kate has expressed the importance of the platform for commerce and has given more
	  reasoning as to why Geocities was unique for having such connections&#151; “Such an archival
	  project is not only admirable; it should be treated as an object lesson in what to do when huge
	  corporations decide that digital services are no longer profitable, as web development
	  technologies come and go, and more and more of the net becomes consolidated into massive,
		  Geist-level platforms. ” (W. Kate, 2019) </p>

	  <p>Her essay has shared mitigations of discontinuing Geocities, which have rivalled larger
	  platforms and share the rise in limitations in web development, leading towards its
	  discontinuation. It summarises how capitalism plays a significant role in limiting such creative
	  acts and supporting commences and developers. After reading Kate’s essay, I learned how web
	  design and the internet have evolved, which have been moulded from overall modernistic
	  standards and cultural norms. In Kate’s response to its importance in documentation, she has
	  also shared that the artefacts of Web 1.0 still offer us a priceless view of what individual and
	  collective agency once meant on the Web. Looking back at them, I’m astonished at the richness
	  of their content, the strangeness that makes them equal to their iconic ’90s predecessors.
	  Throughout her research, she shares how pop culture can revive the appreciation of past eras
	  of the internet by conserving archives and creating awareness projects similar to Olina’s
	  research work. These practices can revive the world of dot-com users and help them appreciate
	  the creative work of developers who have bent the overall structures of modernisation in
		  platform creation and web development. </p>
